excerpt: "Automatic Prediction of Road Surface Type and Quality using Open Data and Machine Learning".
---

Automatic determination of road surface type and quality is essential for various applications in the transport sector, including route planning. However, there is a scarcity of publicly available datasets on road surface type and quality in a standardized format. Typically, such datasets rely on manual analysis and involve substantial effort. Municipalities, in particular, could benefit from these datasets by using them for effective urban planning. 

# The Project 
The mFund project, SurfaceAI, funded by the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport Affairs, aims to address this gap. Open geodata and street images are leveraged to train a machine learning model capable of automatically and precisely categorizing road surfaces and quality in images. The resulting information is converted into georeferenced datasets at street level, which will be made publicly accessible.

# Possible Applications and Associated Project Partners
The project is supported by various organisations that enable the development of use cases and promote networking within the community. 

These include:
- The route planning and navigation provider **Komoot**,  
- The consulting firm **Plan4Better**, which supports local authorities in the development of mobility concepts and has developed the GOAT web tool for accessibility analyses in areas such as walking and cycling,
- The **CityLAB Berlin** technology foundation, which works at the interface between civil society and administration to promote urban development that is geared towards the common good, and
- The start-up **FixMyCity**, which uses digital tools to support cities and local authorities in the transport transition, in particular bicycle traffic planning. 

Two specific application scenarios for the use of the automatically generated road condition data are already being considered. On the one hand, the data can be used directly for route calculation in navigation tools; on the other hand, it can be used for urban planning purposes by analysing and developing efficient and sustainable (bicycle) transport concepts at municipal level.
