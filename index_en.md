excerpt: "Automatic Prediction of Road Surface Type and Quality using Open Data and Machine Learning".
---

Automatic determination of road surface type and quality is crucial for several applications in the transport sector, such as route planning. However, there are few publicly available datasets on road surface type and quality in a standardised format, as they are usually based on manual analysis and require considerable effort. Municipalities in particular could benefit from such datasets and use them for urban planning.

# The Project 
The mFund project SurfaceAI, funded by the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport Affairs, aims to close this gap. To achieve this, open geodata and street images are used to train a machine learning model that is able to automatically and precisely categorise road surfaces and quality on images. The information generated is then converted into georeferenced datasets at street level, which will be publicly accessible.

# Possible Applications and Associated Project Partners
The project is supported by various organisations that enable the development of use cases and promote networking within the community. 

These include:
- the route planning and navigation provider **Komoot**,  
- the consulting firm **Plan4Better**, which supports local authorities in the development of mobility concepts and has developed the GOAT web tool for accessibility analyses in areas such as walking and cycling,
- the **CityLAB Berlin** technology foundation, which works at the interface between civil society and administration to promote urban development that is geared towards the common good, and
- the start-up **FixMyCity**, which uses digital tools to support cities and local authorities in the transport transition, in particular bicycle traffic planning. 

Two specific aplpication scenarios for the use of the automatically generated road condition data are already being considered. On the one hand, the data can be used directly for route calculation in navigation tools; on the other hand, it can be used for analysis and planning in the field of (bicycle) transport planning at municipal level.
