## Legal information

In principle, an order processing contract must be concluded with the hoster. The Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision has made an exception for the hosting of purely static websites. In the event that the website is used for self-presentation, e.g. by associations or small businesses, no personal data flows to the operator and no tracking takes place, there is no order processing. It goes on to say: "The fact that IP addresses, i.e. personal data, must inevitably be processed even when hosting static websites does not lead to the assumption of order processing. This would not be appropriate. Rather, the (short-term) storage of IP addresses is still part of the website hoster's telecommunications access provision in accordance with the TKG and primarily serves the hoster's security purposes." (https://www.lda.bayern.de/media/veroeffentlichungen/FAQ_Hosting_keine_Auftragsverarbeitung.pdf) We assume that this exception applies to GitHub Pages.
